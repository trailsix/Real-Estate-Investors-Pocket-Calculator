# ASSESSED VALUE
# For rental properties, another method of verifying values is to check property tax bills and the local assessed value.
# Checking assessed value for several different properties provides you with a comparison between assessed value and asked price.
# This might reveal inconsistencies or demonstrate an important difference between the realistic market value and a basis used for property taxes.

# 1. Adjusted assessed value is only an estimate
# 2. Specific attributes of the property may be a factor
# 3. Small changes between neighborhoods may affect assessed value
# 4. Seller motivation may also be a factor in how the asked price is set

* Formula: Assessment Ratio
A / P = R
where:
A = assessed value
P = asked price
R = assessment ratio

* Excel Program: Assessment Ratio
A1: assessed value
B1: asked price
C1: =SUM(A1/B1)
