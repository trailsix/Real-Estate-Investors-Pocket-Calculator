# SPREAD
# Two important factors in MLS listings are the spread between asked and sale prices and the amount of time between the original listing date and the closing date.
# Spread is calculated by first determining the difference between asked and sale price, then dividing that difference by the original asked price.  The result expressed as %.
# Sale price is usually lower so the result is a negative %.

* Formula: Spread
(SP - AP) / AP = S
where:
SP = sale price
AP = asked price
S = spread

* Excel Program: Spread
A1: sale price
B1: asked price
C1: =SUM(A1/B1)/B1

Examples:
Buyer's market
AP = $135,000
SP = $129,500
S = -4.1%

Seller's market
AP = $135,000
SP = $142,000
S = 5.2%
